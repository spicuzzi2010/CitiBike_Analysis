## Total Number of Trips in 2020

There was a total of 346,383 trips in 2020.

## Most Popular Stations

The most popular start station for 2020 was Grove St PATH with 23,736 rides. The most popular end station was also Grove St PATH with 29,966. I noticed that the top 5 start and end stations were all the same, which likely means people tend to start and stop at the same station.

## Usership

Total usership has grown 63% in 2020 going from 26,020 users to 42,550 users. 

The number of customers grew 628% going from 1,584 customers to 11,536 customers.

The number of subscribers grew 26% 24,436 subscribers to 31,014 subcribers.

## Best Times to Ride

The Weekend was the most popular time of the week to ride with Saturday being the most popular with 59,838 rides and Sunday was a close second with 53,930 rides.This stayed consistent even when broken down into months.

The most popular time to ride for all of 2020 was 6:00PM (based on start time) with 35,753 rides starting at this time. This held true as the most popular start time for summer hours as the most popular start time with 12,760 total rides starting at this time during the summer months. For the Winter months, 8:00AM was the most popular start time with a total of 5,801 rides starting at this time but 5:00PM and 6:00PM were close behind with a total of 5,005 and 5,069 rides respectively.

## Gender Breakdown

There was a significantally higher number of male participants with a total number of 205,261. There were a total of 87,451 Female users and 53,671 were unknown. 

With these numbers it was no suprise that the males contained a higher number of totals rides throughout 2020 but when looking at average trip duration females consistently had a longer trip duration. 

## Bike Maintenance

Bike ID: 42354 was used the most in 2020 when looking at total number of rides but Bike ID: 42177 had the longest total trip duration of 2020. Both would likely need to be evaluated for maintenance in addition to the other top bikes in these categories.
